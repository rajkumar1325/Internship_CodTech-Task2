## Overview of the Project
### Project: WEATHER FORECAST CHANNEL

This project is a **dynamic and responsive Todo List Application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to efficiently manage their tasks by allowing them to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. The application provides a seamless user experience with an intuitive interface and visually appealing design.

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to provide a lightweight and user-friendly task management solution. It focuses on:
- Simplifying the process of task tracking.
- Offering a visually engaging and interactive interface for managing daily activities.
- Ensuring data persistence during a browser session using session storage.




### Key Activities

1. **Task Management**:
   - Adding new tasks to the list.
   - Marking tasks as completed, with a clear visual distinction for completed tasks.
   - Removing tasks from the list.

2. **Timestamp Feature**:
   - Displaying the current date and time, dynamically updated every second for real-time context.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Storing tasks in `sessionStorage` to maintain the task list during the browser session.

4. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Implementing measures to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by escaping user input.

5. **Interactive UI**:
   - Responsive design with hover effects, animations, and modern styling to enhance the user experience.

- **Cross-Device Compatibility**:
   The application is responsive and functions well across different screen sizes.

- **Intuitive Input Handling**:
   Users can add tasks by pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the "Add" button.

This project serves as a foundational tool for task management, showcasing modern web development practices and user-centric design. It can be further expanded by incorporating features like user authentication, cloud-based storage, or integration with calendar APIs.
